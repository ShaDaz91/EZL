# README

Thanks for reading, this is the readme for the GSL website. If you are reading this either you were able to find the code or you were given permission to be a collaborator/web designer etc.
If you follow in the second category please continue reading.

1) The entire news section and a bunch of the stats section is based off of templates from a website. There is ALOT of stuff i removed from their templates but all the css and js code images all this stuff is still in the website code. I need help removing all the excess stuff. To do this clone the entire repository and use remove each one by one and find out which ones are unnecessary code.
2) Have fun!!

Hello
